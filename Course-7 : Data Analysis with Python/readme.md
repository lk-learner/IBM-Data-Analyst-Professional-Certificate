## About this Course

Analyzing data with Python is an essential skill for Data Scientists and Data Analysts. This course will take you from the basics of data analysis with Python to building and evaluating data models.  

Topics covered include:  
- collecting and importing data 
- cleaning, preparing & formatting data 
- data frame manipulation 
- summarizing data 
- building machine learning regression models 
- model refinement 
- creating data pipelines 

You will learn how to import data from multiple sources, clean and wrangle data, perform exploratory data analysis (EDA), and create meaningful data visualizations. You will then predict future trends from data by developing linear, multiple, polynomial regression models & pipelines and learn how to evaluate them.  
  
#### What you will learn : 
  
- Develop Python code for cleaning and preparing data for analysis - including handling missing values, formatting, normalizing, and binning data

- Perform exploratory data analysis and apply analytical techniques to real-word datasets using libraries such as Pandas, Numpy and Scipy

- Manipulate data using dataframes, summarize data, understand data distribution, perform correlation and create data pipelines

- Build and evaluate regression models using machine learning scikit-learn library and use them for prediction and decision making
 

### Libraries Used : Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, NumPy, sklearn

### Tasks Performed on the dataset:
* **Importing Data**
  * Import of Data (csv file) using Pandas
  * Understanding the data 
* **Data Wrangling**
  * Analyzing Dataset values
  * Finding an replacing NaN values
* **Exploratory Data Analysis**
  * Using functions to obtain value count of houses that fall under certain conditions
  * Plotting data to check for the presence of outliers 
  * Understanding correlation in the data  
* **Model Development**
  * Scaling the data
  * Fitting a Regression Model 
  * Predictions using a list of features
  * Obtaining R^2 value and analysing this score
* **Model Refinement and Evaluation**
  * Splitting the data into training and testing data
  * Using Ridge regression to introduce a regularization parameter
  * Fitting a regression model
  * Making predictions using data 
  * Obtaining a score to check the performance of model
  * Refining the model by performing a polynomial transform on the data
  * Analyzing the model performance
